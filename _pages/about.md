I received Ph.D. in [National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition](https://nlpr.ia.ac.cn/en) from [CASIA](https://www.ia.cas.cn/) in 2020 and received B.E. in [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.uestc.edu.cn/) from [UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2015, respectively.

I currently serve as a Tech Leader at Huawei [Pangu Lab](https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/pangu.html). Specializing in AGI and AI4S, I am leading a team to seek the solution for handling infinite tasks, even the unseen ones, within a single AI model, abandoning the traditional approach of repeatedly developing numerous specialized models. I have authored or co-authored over 50 papers published in CSUR‌‌, T-PAMI, NeurIPS, _etc._, and these papers have influenced the works of the Turing Award/Marr Prize winners. See the [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RDwnNsQAAAAJ) for details.
