I received Ph.D. in [National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition](https://nlpr.ia.ac.cn/en) from [CASIA](https://www.ia.cas.cn/) in 2020 and received B.E. in [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.uestc.edu.cn/) from [UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2015, respectively.

I currently serve as a Tech Leader at Huawei. Specializing in AGI and AI4S, I lead a team dedicated to developing a unified solution for [identifying and addressing an open-ended range of tasks](https://jianlongchange.github.io/AI_Pangaea/) including those previously unseen—while moving beyond the traditional paradigm of building numerous task-specific models. I have authored or co-authored over [50 publications](https://jianlongchange.github.io/publications/) in prestigious venues, including CSUR, IEEE T-PAMI, and NeurIPS. Beyond my research, I contribute to the community as an Area Chair for premier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, and CVPR. For a complete list of my work, please refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RDwnNsQAAAAJ).
