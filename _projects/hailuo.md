In cement production, manual experience is required to set the corresponding parameters to achieve higher cement output and lower energy consumption while ensuring quality, enhancing economic benefits, and reducing waste. The current parameter settings rely on manual experience, making it difficult to achieve stable cement production. Additionally, manual experience is hard to pass on, and when employees resign or retire, related experience may be lost.

The Pangu Large model, implemented at the Quanjiao Conch pilot plant through cooperation between both parties, has achieved nearly 100% online automatic setting of process parameters. This has improved the stability of the decomposition furnace temperature by over 40%, reduced kiln condition anomalies by over 50%, and enhanced the stability of clinker quality by over 40%. Additionally, it has reduced labor intensity by more than 24%, achieving remarkable results.
