The manual coal blending experience is difficult to pass on, heavily relying on individual expertise. In the plant, coal blending engineers' manual experience cannot be effectively transferred and can only be handed over by senior workers training new employees. New coal blending engineers are slow to get started on their own and are increasingly difficult to recruit. Meanwhile, the cost of raw coal is high, traditional coal blending values are conservative, quality indicators are often excessive, increasing coking costs. The quality is unstable, and manual experience can only provide rough estimates of coal blending and coking results, making fine calculations impossible. The results of coal blending and coking are highly dependent on personal experience, making it difficult to accurately predict coke quality.

The coal blending time is too long, due to the complexity of coal quality information indicators, coal blending engineers spend a lot of time planning meticulously to adapt to new raw coal.

The Pangu Large model has been deployed in the 1880 hot rolling production line of Baowu Steel Group, improving prediction accuracy by over 5%, increasing the steel plate yield rate by 0.5%. It is estimated that an additional 20,000 tons of steel plates can be produced annually, generating an annual revenue increase of over 90 million RMB.
