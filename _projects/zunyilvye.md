The dynamic optimization of the electrolytic aluminum system has led to improvements in production efficiency, product quality, and reduced energy consumption, setting a benchmark for intelligent and green production in the entire electrolytic aluminum industry.

Based on datasets such as slot control daily reports and inspection and testing data, the Pangu Large model employs scientific prediction methods to achieve efficient calculation and analysis of the molecular ratio, fluoride addition amount, and aluminum output. It precisely predicts the optimal combination of key parameters in the production process. So far, the deviation between the predicted and actual values of the molecular ratio prediction model has been controlled within 0.06, with a fitting degree as high as 0.85.
