With years of profound accumulation, China National Logging Corporation (CNLC) has established the largest logging data platform both at home and abroad. This platform has gathered precious data from over one million well operations, covering energy information, as well as various resources information such as oil, natural gas, all kinds of metallic and non-metallic minerals, and coal. These data span a history of a hundred years and are highly value-intensive. Through in-depth mining, CNLC has fully unleashed their potential value, providing powerful data support for energy development, resource management, and industry decision-making.

However, the irregular lateral distribution of basins in China and the complex geological features have significantly increased the difficulty of oil and gas exploration, discovery, and development. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence modeling not only poses great challenges but also has insufficient generalization ability, making it difficult to be widely promoted and applied on a large scale. Therefore, the process of building relevant models is extremely cumbersome and requires a huge amount of work.
The preliminary technical verification results of the Pangu Logging Large Model are exciting. It shows that artificial intelligence based on the large model can more efficiently and accurately assist in production business scenarios such as horizon division, parameter calculation, and oil and gas identification. The prediction accuracy and generalization ability demonstrated by this large model have greatly enhanced the confidence of CNLC in engaging in the research and development of logging large models.
