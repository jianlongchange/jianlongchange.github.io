Based on the Pangu Large model, RTO (Real-Time Optimization) model training is conducted, enabling the gasification unit to precisely simulate and predict key operating parameters such as gasifier furnace temperature, slag layer thickness, and slag viscosity. This ensures in-depth optimization and extreme stability of the production process.

After six months of stable production, there has been a significant reduction in human intervention and labor intensity, greatly enhancing the stability and safety of the unit’s operation. Additionally, coal consumption has been reduced by 1.33%, with an estimated coal savings of 9,100 tons per year and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 20,086 tons per year, which can bring direct economic benefits exceeding 10 million RMB annually.
