Durian is highly renowned in Thailand, and even during the pandemic, Thailand's durian export volume in the first quarter remained at the top globally, with particularly strong demand from the Chinese market. In response to this strong market demand, the processes of durian harvesting, storage, international logistics, and storage in China are all critical checkpoints. Failure to properly control these operations and storage times will affect the quality of durians reaching the Chinese market.

The Pangu Large model, by collecting and analyzing Durian's Dry Matter (DM) data and optimizing detection algorithms, can quickly categorize durians into three major categories: immature, mature, and overripe. This ensures that every durian is sufficiently mature, meeting the standards of buyers and exporters, thus solving the problem of selling unripe or low-quality durians, and increasing confidence among consumers both domestically and abroad.
